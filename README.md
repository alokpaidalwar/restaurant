All the employees take orders from customers from the menu given below:
Item Rate (in Rs.)
Tea - 10
Coffee - 10
Samosa - 15
Cake - 15

For simplicity, we have assumed that each customer orders only category of
items from the menu i.e. if a customer orders Cake, then he can buy as many
cakes he wants however he canâ€™t buy tea, coffee or samosas. We need to
calculate the total amount (in Rs.) collected by the particular employee using
the quantity ordered and the rate of the item ordered and store all this
information in the database.

There is also a reports page, which contains following charts for the
employee who has signed in:
1. A line graph comparing the total sales done for each day.
2. A pie chart containing the products sold by quantity
3. A bar graph containing the total sales done product wise.
